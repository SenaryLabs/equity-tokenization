  **What is Fusion Finance?**
  
Fusion Finance is a protocol that tokenizes equities by using public blockchains to send trade and settlement instructions to traditional financial entities like broker-dealers and custodians. Unlike typical tokenization, it doesnâ€™t create new digital assets but uses tokens to instruct actions, keeping assets traded on existing exchanges for deep liquidity.

- Fusion Finance tokenizes securities using blockchain as a messaging system, not for settlement, to maintain liquidity and comply with regulations.  
- It solves liquidity fragmentation and operational challenges by integrating with traditional exchanges.  
- Use cases include prime brokerage, tokenized funds, DeFi integration, and cross-border settlements.  
- Future beneficiaries include retail and institutional investors, custodians, DeFi developers, and regulators.

**How Does It Work?**  
- Clients submit orders via APIs, web apps, or smart contracts.  
- The protocol issues "directive tokens" that encode these instructions, which are sent via blockchain to custodians.  
- Custodians execute trades on traditional exchanges, with settlements recorded on-chain for transparency.  
- Tokens have transfer restrictions to ensure only verified clients can trade, meeting regulatory needs.  

**What Problem Does It Solve?**  
It addresses issues like fragmented liquidity and off-chain settlement dependencies in traditional tokenization. By leveraging existing exchange liquidity, it avoids the challenge of creating new markets, and its hybrid approach ensures regulatory compliance, making it easier for institutions to adopt.


**Use Cases and Examples**  
- **Prime Brokerage:** Offers leverage on tokenized assets across custodians, like using tokens for collateral management.  
- **Tokenized Funds:** Funds can accept stablecoin subscriptions, making investments more accessible.  
- **DeFi Integration:** Tokens can be used in lending or yield farming, bridging traditional finance with DeFi.  
- **Cross-Border:** Reduces friction in global trades by standardizing instructions on blockchain.  

**Who Benefits in the Future?**  
- Retail investors get fractional ownership and DeFi opportunities.  
- Institutional investors gain efficiency without losing compliance.  
- Custodians and broker-dealers streamline operations.  
- DeFi developers build new apps with tokenized securities.  
- Regulators get transparent, auditable records for oversight.  


#### Background
The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), particularly equities, has emerged as a transformative force in financial markets, promising enhanced liquidity, accessibility, and operational efficiency. However, early efforts in RWA tokenization have encountered significant hurdles, including fragmented liquidity, dependency on off-chain settlement, and regulatory uncertainty. These challenges have limited the scalability and adoption of tokenized assets, particularly in bridging traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi).

Fusion Finance, as outlined in the provided draft, introduces a novel equities tokenization protocol that integrates public blockchain networks with traditional financial infrastructure. Unlike conventional models that create distinct digital representations of assets, Fusion Finance leverages blockchain as a messaging system to facilitate trade, settlement, and transfer instructions among regulated entities such as broker-dealers, issuers, and custodians. This hybrid approach aims to preserve the integrity of underlying instruments while unlocking blockchain-native functionalities like smart contract automation and regulatory compliance.

#### Core Mechanism: Directive Tokenization
At the heart of Fusion Finance is its *directive tokenization* model, a concept also referenced in similar projects like Ondo Finance's Ondo GM ([Ondo Finance brings stocks and bonds onchain with new platform](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ondo-finance-tokenized-securities-platform-onchain)). Directive tokenization involves issuing tokens that represent rights to instruct entities that custody the asset to perform intended transactions, rather than creating fully tokenized representations of financial assets. These tokens encode trade and settlement instructions within smart contracts, enabling a programmable interface for financial operations.

The protocol's architecture is divided into three layers, as derived from the draft and supported by industry practices for distributed financial market infrastructures (dFMI) ([distributed Financial Market Infrastructure (dFMI) and the Disintermediation of Digital Assets | by Clearmatics | clearmatics | Medium](https://medium.com/clearmatics/dfmi-and-the-disintermediation-of-digital-assets-6be7a5551870)):

| **Layer**                | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Client Interface Layer   | Accepts client buy/sell orders through traditional methods (APIs, web applications) and blockchain-native methods (smart contract calls). |
| Blockchain Messaging Layer | Utilizes public blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Cardano) as a tamper-proof messaging system to relay instructions to participating entities. |
| Traditional Settlement Layer | Leverages existing exchanges and custodians for final settlement, ensuring compatibility with public market infrastructure. |

The workflow, as detailed in the draft, operates as follows:
1. A client submits a buy/sell order through the Fusion platform.
2. The protocol mints a directive token encoding the transaction details (e.g., asset, quantity, price).
3. The token is transmitted via the blockchain to the relevant custodian or broker-dealer.
4. The custodian executes the instruction on a traditional exchange, with settlement recorded on-chain for transparency.
5. Subsequent actions, such as transfers or redemptions, are managed via additional token instructions, ensuring effective asset lifecycle management.

Key innovations include:
- **Public Market Liquidity:** By integrating with existing traditional exchanges, Fusion Finance provides immediate and deep liquidity for public securities, eliminating the challenges associated with creating liquidity for new tokenized assets on DeFi applications.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Tokens carry transfer restrictions, limiting transfers to other Fusion Protocol clients, ensuring adherence to securities laws and regulations ([Tokenized Assets: An Ally to Regulatory Compliance | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tokenized-assets-an-ally-to-regulatory-compliance)). This is achieved through whitelisting and compliance checks, aligning with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements ([Real World Asset Tokenization: Regulatory Landscape At A Glance | Bitbond](https://www.bitbond.com/resources/real-world-asset-tokenization-regulatory-landscape-at-a-glance/)).
- **Smart Contract Automation:** Programmable tokens enable advanced financial workflows, such as automated collateral management, dividend distribution, and integration with DeFi protocols, enhancing operational efficiency.

#### Problems Addressed
The Fusion Finance protocol directly tackles several structural inefficiencies in traditional RWA tokenization:
- **Fragmented Representations:** Many pioneering projects create asset class representations distinct from the underlying security, introducing additional complexity and fragmentation that hinder liquidity. Fusion Finance avoids this by maintaining the connection to traditional exchanges, as noted in the draft.
- **Off-Chain Dependencies:** Dependency on off-chain settlement poses operational challenges and reduces transparency. By using blockchain as a messaging layer, Fusion Finance ensures immutability and auditability of instructions, aligning with dFMI developments ([Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)](https://www.bis.org/cpmi/info_pfmi.htm)).
- **Liquidity Challenges:** The protocol leverages existing exchange liquidity, addressing the difficulty of bootstrapping liquidity for new tokenized assets, a common issue highlighted in tokenization literature ([Tokenization in asset management | EY - US](https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/financial-services/tokenization-in-asset-management)).
- **Regulatory Uncertainty:** Unrestricted token transfers on public blockchains can violate securities laws. Fusion Finance mitigates this through transfer restrictions and client verification, ensuring compliance with jurisdictions like the US, where tokenized securities often fall under SEC regulations ([Tokenized Real-World Assets: Pathways to SEC Registration | Fenwick](https://www.fenwick.com/insights/publications/tokenized-real-world-assets-pathways-to-sec-registration)).

#### Use Cases and Practical Applications
Fusion Finance's directive tokenization model enables a range of use cases, as outlined in the draft and expanded below:
